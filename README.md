## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this social proof section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Nothing in particular, but this challenge is a great exercise in grids, flex boxes and CSS properties like :nth-of-type().

### Continued development

Continue to develop pages with various layouts requiring the use of grids

### Useful resources
